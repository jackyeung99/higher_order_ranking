EX01: Accuracy Testing (Synthetic Data)
    Objective: Measure the accuracy of models according to log likelihood,Leadership log likelihood, Spearman Rho, and Kendall Tau
    Procedure: Measure the performance on synthetic datasets with different combinations of N, M, K1, K2

EX02: Convergence Testing (Synthetic Data)
    Objective: Analyze the improvement of convergence on different synthetic examples
    Procedure: Measure the convergence of our iterative scheme and zermellos iterative scheme on synthetic datasets with different combinations of N, M, K1, K2

EX03: Accuracy Testing (Real Data)
    Objective: Apply the models to real-world datasets and evaluate the performance of likelihood functions.
    Procedure: Use multiple real datasets, and for each, compute the likelihood for the model under investigation.

EX04: Convergence Testing (Real Data)
    Objective: Apply the models to real-world datasets and evaluate the performance of convergence. 
    Procedure: Use multiple real datasets, and for each, measure the convergence of our iteration scheme compared to zermellos
